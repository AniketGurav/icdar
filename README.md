Scanned receipts OCR is a process of recognizing text from scanned structured and semi-structured receipts, and invoices in general. On the other hand, extracting key texts from receipts and invoices and save the texts to structured documents can serve many applications and services, such as efficient archiving, fast indexing and document analytics. Scanned receipts OCR and information extraction (SROIE) play critical roles in streamlining document-intensive processes and office automation in many financial, accounting and taxation areas. However, SROIE also faces big challenges. With performance greatly boosted by recent breakthroughs in deep learning technologies in terms of accuracy and processing speed, OCR is becoming mature for many practical tasks (such as name card recognition, license plate recognition and hand-written text recognition). However, receipts OCR has much higher accuracy requirements than the general OCR tasks for many commercial applications. And SROIE becomes more challenging when the scanned receipts have low quality. Therefore, in the existing SROIE systems, human resources are still heavily used in SROIE. There is an urgent need to research and develop fast, efficient and robust SROIE systems to reduce and even eliminate manual work.
